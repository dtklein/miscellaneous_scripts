#Just some miscellaneous tools I have built to teach myself or to scratch an overly specific itch
## One-line descriptions of the files in here
  - LJ_extract_content.py -- Combine a Linux Journal article to a single page for linear reading and decruft it
  - craigslist_to_pdf.py -- Grab a CL add at a moment in time for offline reading of archive
  - Add_RunAs_Administrator_To_PowerShell_Right_Click.ps1 -- Q&D setup script to add Run As Administrator to ps1 scripts in Windows Explorer
  - program_codename_generator.ps1 -- A funny tool that creates program code names, based on the patterns of code names from the documents stolen by Edward Snowden and created to troll my team mates after the Shadow Broker Group attempted to sell a suite of TAO tools allegedly found abandoned on a C&C server operated by the so-call Equation Group
  - fix_chrome_app_icons_in_windows_10.ps1 -- A tool to unbreak the Windows metro icons in the wide section of the Windows 10 flag-menu for Chrome apps. This is incomplete and slightly b0rken, because Start-Process and the Pac-Man-like gulping of quotes is trying to either give me ulcer or drive me bonkers
